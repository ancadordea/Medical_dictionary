Term,Definition
asthma,a condition in which a person's airways become inflamed and make it hard to breathe.
diabetes,a disease where the body cannot properly process sugar.
hypertension,also known as high blood pressure.
anemia,a condition where you lack enough healthy red blood cells.
arthritis,inflammation of the joints that causes pain and stiffness.
tumour,an abnormal mass of tissue that may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
cancer,a disease where cells divide uncontrollably and can invade other parts of the body.
benign,a tumour that is not cancerous and does not spread to other parts of the body.
malignant,a cancerous tumour that can invade nearby tissues and spread (metastasize) to other parts.
metastasis,the process by which cancer cells spread from the original site to other parts of the body.
carcinoma,a type of cancer that starts in the skin or tissues lining internal organs.
sarcoma,"a cancer that starts in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, or other connective tissues."
leukemia,"cancer of the blood-forming tissues, such as bone marrow."
chemotherapy,treatment using drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells.
radiation therapy,treatment using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells.
biopsy,a procedure to remove a small sample of tissue for testing to diagnose cancer.
oncology,the branch of medicine that deals with cancer diagnosis and treatment.
genome,"the complete set of dna, including all of its genes, in an organism."
gene,a segment of dna that contains instructions for making proteins.
mutation,a change in the dna sequence that can affect gene function.
genotype,the genetic makeup of an organism; the set of genes it carries.
phenotype,the observable traits or characteristics resulting from the genotype and environment.
sequencing,the process of determining the exact order of nucleotides in a dna molecule.
biomarker,a biological molecule that indicates a normal or abnormal process or disease state.
epigenetics,study of changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in dna sequence.
transcriptome,all the rna molecules expressed from the genome at a given time.
precision medicine,an approach to patient care that uses genetic information to tailor treatments.
regulatory t cells (tregs),"a subset of t cells that suppress immune responses, potentially aiding in tumor immune evasion."
fibroblasts,"connective tissue cells that can differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (cafs), contributing to the extracellular matrix and influencing tumor stiffness and metastasis."
extracellular matrix (ecm),"a complex network of proteins and carbohydrates surrounding cells, providing structural support and influencing cell behavior."
hypoxia,"a condition of low oxygen levels within tumors, often leading to increased angiogenesis and resistance to therapies."
